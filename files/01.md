## Politics and Code: Criticism of Technology

> "Be conservative in what you do. Be liberal in what you accept from others."<sup>[Postel 1980](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc761#section-2.10)</sup>  
> It may seem strange that such a philosophical, perhaps even spiritual, principle should be embedded in the articulation of the Internet, but then network design, like all design, can be understood as ideology embodied, and the Internet clearly bore the stamp of the opposition to bigness characteristic of the era. Not long thereafter, three professors of computer science, David Reed, David Clark, and Jerome Saltzer, would try to explain what made the Internet so distinctive and powerful. In a seminal paper of 1984, “End-to-End Arguments in System Design,” they argued for the enormous potential inherent in decentralizing decisional authority—giving it to the network users (the “ends”). The network itself (the “middle”) should, they insisted, be as nonspecialized as possible, so as to serve the “ends” in any ways they could imagine. What were such notions if not the computer science version of what Hayek and Jacobs, Kohr and Schumacher, had been arguing. While we cannot say exactly that the network pioneers of the 1970s were disciples of these or any particular thinker, there is no denying the general climate of thought in which computer scientists were living, along with everybody else. Coming of age concurrently with an ideological backlash against centralized planning and authority, the Internet became a creature of its times.
